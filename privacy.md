This privacy policy applies to the Geo Wander app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by SOICHI SATO (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Commercial service. This service is intended for use "AS IS". This Application is currently available for iOS.

Information Collection and Use
The Application collects information when you download and use it. This may include:

- Game session data associated with your account (e.g., gameplay results, timestamps, distance/steps)
- Precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) necessary for gameplay
- Diagnostic logs (e.g., error messages) may be collected for troubleshooting. Automatic crash reporting is not implemented at this time.
- Password (for authentication). Passwords are processed solely via Firebase Authentication and are not stored by the Service Provider.
- Email Address (for account authentication and for contacting you with important notices regarding the service)
The Application collects your device's location solely to enable core gameplay features, including:

- Map rendering, Street View interactions, guessing locations, and scoring
- Saving your game session history associated with your account
  The Application does not use location for advertising.
The Service Provider may use the information you provide to contact you from time to time with important information or required notices. Marketing communications are not currently used.

Photo Handling
Photos captured in-app are processed locally to generate share images. The Application does not upload photo content to servers. Only a local device URI (photo metadata) may be referenced within your game session data. This URI may be stored as part of session data in Firebase Firestore but does not point to a server-hosted image and may become invalid if the local file is removed or the app is reinstalled.

Third Party Access
For functionality, certain User Provided Data (e.g., identifiers, game session data, and location) is transmitted to Firebase and RevenueCat. Authentication credentials (email and password) are processed by Firebase Authentication. Photo content is not transmitted to Firebase or RevenueCat; only session metadata (including a local URI string) may be stored.
The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways described in this privacy statement.
