Article 2 (Account Registration)
To use certain features of the Application, Users are required to register an account using an email address and password.

The Application is a game service where Users use their device's location information and a provided Street View image (hint) to find a destination by actually walking.

The Application offers a "Free Plan" (available at no cost) and a "Pro Plan" (paid).

Free Plan: Gameplay is limited to once per day, and the playable area is restricted to the "500m" range only.
